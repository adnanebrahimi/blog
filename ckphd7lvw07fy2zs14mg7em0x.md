## Why writing is essential for developers

Hello friends!

This is the first article that I want to write as a developer.
Recently, I decided to improve my soft skills after reading  [Soft Skills: The software
developer's life manual](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23232941-soft-skills). 

Writing is essential for developers from the point of my
view. because writing will push us to think more and deeply.
Another point is writing will improve writing skills there is a good resource to learn
and improve technical writing out there the best one that I found is from  [Google
Developer](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing) .

I want to write about the things that I learned or that I think are interesting to other
developers as well.

Thanks All :)
